    <p>
        Cloud Ascend is a two-day workshop organized by GDSC MPSTME. The workshop
        aims to teach participants about Docker and DevOps with Google Cloud
        Console, and how to use these technologies to create and deploy scalable
        and secure applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        The workshop consists of two parts: a collaborative speaker session on
        November 2, 2023, and a hands-on workshop on November 3, 2023. The speaker
        session will feature experts from the field of Google Cloud and Generative
        AI, who will share their insights and experiences on topics such as cloud
        computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language
        processing. The workshop will provide practical guidance and exercises on
        how to use Docker and DevOps tools to build, test, and deploy AI models on
        Google Cloud Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        The workshop is open to anyone who is interested in learning more about
        Google Cloud and Generative AI, regardless of their level of expertise or
        background. Participants who attend both days of the workshop will receive
        an exclusive certificate acknowledging their active engagement and
        learning in this event.
